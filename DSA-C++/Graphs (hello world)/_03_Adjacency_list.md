# Adjacency List
in matrix , we store redundant information means, store also that vertes which is not connected.


♦ Adjacency list is formed by vector

♦ space req = O(v+e)
♦ check u and v are adjacent = O(v)
♦ find all verties adj to u = O(v) 
♦ find degree of u = O(1)
♦ addon edge = O(1)
♦ remove on edge = O(v)
