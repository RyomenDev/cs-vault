# Properties of binary tree

♦ the maximum number of nodes at level 'l' of a binary tree is 2^l.
        level 0-1-2-3-...
♦ Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is 2^h-1 .
        height 1-2-3-..
    if height 0-1-2-...  2^(h+1)-1
♦ In a binary tree with N nodes , *minimun possible height* or minimum number of levels is --  log2(n+1)-*1*
♦In binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 childen, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
