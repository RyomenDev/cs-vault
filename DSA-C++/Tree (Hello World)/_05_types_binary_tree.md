# Full Binary tree

if every node has 0 or 2 children. (All nodes except leaf nodes have two children.)

# Complete Binary tree

if all the levels are completely filles except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left(aligned) as possible.

# perfect binary tree

all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level

# balanced binary tree

if the height of the tree is O(logn) where n is the number of nodes.
eg.♦ AVL tree (difference b/w height of the left and right subtrees is almost 1.)
   ♦Red-Black Tree

# Degenerate (or pathological) Binary Tree    
every internal node has one child.
such trees are performance wise same as linked list.
