/*

1) time complexity
 2) inplace sorting algorithms--> take constant memory (for 9 or 9k)
works on rearranging --> bubble sort
 3) stability : elements order same as output order (for equal elements.)
 4) internal sorting algorithm -> all data is loaded into memory (all at same time)
    external sorting algorithm -> all data is not loaded into memory (read one by one)
 5)daptive -> already sorted data takes less time.
 6) recursive / non recursive
